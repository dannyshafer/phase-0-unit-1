 This was a fun challenge. I've done some ruby before but it was a while ago and it was good to get a refresher. Ruby is a really enjoyable language and knowing that we'll be largely doing that at DBC is one of the reasons I'm glad to be here rather than Hack Reactor or another bootcamp that focuses, from what I understand, on the JS stack (JS is not my fav). Some challenges arose while doing the rspec tests where I was getting the correct output but the test wasn't passing. It took a while but I realized that the method needed to "return" and not "puts" the output. Crazy times!
