## Releases

## Release 0: Read ch.9: Writing Your Own Methods
So you already know a bit about methods. Here is a chance to cement your understanding.

If you want to work on Pine's challenges as a bonus, feel free to add a file and add your code in this directory.

## Release 1: Exercises
Complete the following exercises. Be sure to take advantage of pairing!

- [Factorial](../exercises/19-factorial)
- [Add it up](../exercises/20-add-it-up)

## Release 2: Reflect
In your [my_reflection.md](my_reflection.md) use the [reflection guidelines](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/reflection-guidelines.md) to reflect on your learning. Remember, reflections should be directed toward an audience, but they don't need to be lengthy. A short paragraph will suffice. Try to keep your reflection writing to 10-15 minutes.

## Release 3: Create a pull Request
Add and commit your changes, then make a pull request to your fork. Using the GitHub web interface, merge your pull request into your fork's master branch.
