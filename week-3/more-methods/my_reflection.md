 I paired with Marshall Hattersley for this challenge and it was a lot of fun. We were able to solve both of the problems relatively quickly as we both have somewhat of a background with ruby. He was especially helpful with the refactoring as he was able to point out times that we could reduce the code to be more concise. We had our roles defined very well and so I enjoyed being the driver for the challenge. There weren't really any parts where we struggled and I feel very comfortable with the learning objectives for this challenge.
