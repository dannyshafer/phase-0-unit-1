# U1.W3: Methods: Notes for Numbers and Letters

#### I spent 1 hours on this challenge.


### Summary
- What does `puts` do?

	Puts is short for "put string" and will print out whatever you pass to it, whether it's a "string" in quotes, a math problem, or even another vriable. 

- What is the difference between float and integer division?

	The difference between float and integer division is that float will take you to decimal places needed to be an accurate solution while integer division will round to the nearest whole number. 

### Try it!

My solution for:

1.  Hours in a year

```ruby
puts 365 * 24
```

2. Minutes in a decade

```ruby
puts 60 * 24 * 365 * 10 
```

 This was a pretty straightforward challenge. Perhaps some of it was review since I had already done a bit of ruby in the past. Review is always appreciated as the fundamentals are what everything else is built on. 

```ruby
 Puts "Yay!"
