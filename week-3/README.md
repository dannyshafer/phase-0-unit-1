# Week 3: Introduction to Ruby

<!-- Week 3's curriculum will be released with changes first thing on Monday morning PST. -->

It's time to fetch changes from DevBootcamp's phase-0-unit-1 master repo to get the newly-released curriculum. Make sure you are in the master branch of your phase-0-unit-1 repo. Check where you are in your terminal first. DO NOT try fetching these changes into your [USERNAME].github.io repo. You will mess things up! Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/fetching-changes.md) for fetching changes.

You'll want to get a copy of Chris Pine's *Learn to Program, 2nd edition*. You can get this in an instant e-book or paperback format from the publisher or on Amazon. The first version is available online for free. If you choose to use the first version, the chapter numbers will be different and there may be some information that is missing. This week, you will be reading the content in the book and then completing the exercises we assign.

Please go through the challenges in order (as indicated below). Exercises (from the exercises directory) will be referenced in each challenge. Please read through the challenge and complete the exercises as instructed. Also, you should skip Chris Pine's exercises unless specifically asked to complete them.

### RSpec
Some challenges have tests that will help you determine whether you've met the minimum requirements in the challenge. These tests have been written using RSpec, a popular testing framework for Ruby. If you want more information on RSpec, read Team Treehouse's [blog post](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/an-introduction-to-rspec) on it. Please note, you will not be expected to write, or even fully understand RSpec in Phase 0. Focus on the output of the tests, which are designed to be readable and let you know what your code isn't doing that it should. If you have difficulty, please post on the community.

## Challenges:
Before starting, please read Chris Pine's Introduction p. xi - xv. The chapters are based on the 2nd edition of the book.

** These length estimates are calculated from past cohort averages. The *Well-Grounded Rubyist* readings were not attached or required.

Please note, we put the blog challenges at the end of the week, but you can decide when to work on them. They may be helpful to do in the middle of the week or when you're stuck in another challenge.

This week you'll want to request feedback on Twitter using the hashtag **#DBCU1W3.** Only other DBC students can actually see your repositories because they are private.

## Submitting your work
- You must complete the [week's submission form](http://apply.devbootcamp.com) to turn in your work.
- The week's work is due each Sunday by 11:59pm.

**If you do not finish by the deadline:**
- Complete the Unit 1 extension request. (You only get one extension for Unit 1)
- When the work is complete, turn it in using the [week's submission form](http://apply.devbootcamp.com).

## Working through the challenges
Once you have the entire local repository on your computer, you don't need to read the challenges on GitHub anymore (although we admit, it's prettier). You can open the entire repository in Sublime and read the challenges in their original markdown. It will also help you find any link issues, since you can see where they are pointing. If you do find broken links, please let us know by posting on the community. You should also try to figure out a fix -- it will help your markdown skills!

## Remember the Unit Expectations!
