- Did you enjoy wireframing your site?

	Yes, admittedly it was hard to come up with any unique ideas so it looks kind of canned at the moment. 

- Did you find yourself revising your wireframe often? Or did you stick with your first idea?

	I didn't change much of the content, just experimenting with positioning and whatnot. 

- What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

	There was just a lot of Googling about different tools to use and trying to understand from online resources what the process is, where wireframing fits into the larger website building process, and what the steps are associated wih wireframing. 

- What concepts are you having trouble with?

	The artistic piece of it is a challenge, the aesthetics. I'm not a very artsy person and that isn't a huge deal in most of website building, but the design process is probably more difficult for me than the average learner. 

- Did you learn any new skills or tricks?

	I had never really wireframed before so it was all new. At the same time, I learned very clearly that spotty internet takes down your day pretty quickly. 

- How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge?

	Pretty confident. :D 

- Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?

	I really liked looking at the finished product. That's satisfying. 

- Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
	
	Aligning individual boxes was admittedly a little boring. But it comes with the territory!
