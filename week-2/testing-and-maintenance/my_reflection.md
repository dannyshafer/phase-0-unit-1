## 9. Testing and Maintenance Reflection

#### I spent 1 hours on this challenge.

Include images of your maintenance schedule (inline, using markdown) below:

Schedule:

- While testing, did you find any errors in your code? How did you handle them?

  One of the biggest issues that testing brought up was differences in font rendering across different browsers. This might also be an issue of cached versions in browsers. I don't really know what I'm talking about but I do know that it's something that I'll be working on to rectify. It's mostly fixed but doesn't work in my home installation of Chrome. Also the home page picture renders improperly on large screens. 
  
- Did you receive any particularly helpful feedback? Why was it helpful?

  Fix the font issue
  
- How do you plan to incorporate the feedback you received?

  There will be a lot of googling for solutions and the like. If I were to hazard a guess, webkit will help with the cross-browser font issues and changing the picture width to a percent (if it isn't already?) should fix the photo rendering.
