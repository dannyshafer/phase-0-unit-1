## 5. Beginning CSS Reflection

<<<<<<< HEAD
#### I spent 2 hours on this challenge.

- What makes sense to you about CSS? What doesn't?

	The way it works at a fundamental level is much more straightforward than a lot of coding languages. It's just a matter of finding a way to identify the element that you want to manipulate and then moving over to your css file and hooking up the changes you want. No fuss, no muss as they say. 

- What seems good and bad about CSS?

	The good is basically what I said in the answer to the last question. The bad is the point where that simple answer breaks down. Nested selectors and the whole parent-child situation have definitely thrown me for a loop at times. 

- Did you have any "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?

	Not yet, but as I say, the week is young. :D

- Did you have any experience before with HTML/CSS? If so, how much? If not, how hard did you feel it was to learn?

	I've been doing web development for a while and so this has been a good review of the fundamentals and good chance to round out my existing knowledge.

- When you looked at Berkshire Hathaway's source code, what were your first impressions of their code?

	I was genuinely impressed. There doesn't seem to be much css at all. Granted it's a simple website, but css would make it easier (and the amount they did use certainly helped). Harvey and I were talking about how it's the fourth largest company in the country and that literally is their website. In the same way that we craft online presences and our personal brand and all that stuff, I suspect that Warren Buffett would have had it like this on purpose and you've got to respect that. 

- Which site followed best practices based on what you know about best practices?

	Their site probably used best practice. We didn't even touch things like webkit so there might be some cross-browser issues in ours that presumably theirs wouldn't have, if I understand the purpose of webkit?
