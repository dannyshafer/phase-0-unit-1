## 6. Blog Template Challenge Reflection

<<<<<<< HEAD
#### I spent 5 hours on this challenge.

- What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?

	CSS positioning is doomed to be the thing that haunts my life for the rest of life. I think there was an hour or so where I was trying to get an ampersand in the right spot. It was worth it. Even experienced developer friends tell me that CSS positioning is disproprtionately difficult for what it is. 

- Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
	
	Learning the difference between fixed, absolute, and relative positioning were pretty big to internalize and I'm definitely getting more comfortable with them than I was before. 

- How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge?

	Very comfortable, but always room for improvement. More specifically, I need to get better at makign wireframes and sticking with them rather than making them and then making websites that are way different (albeit better, so it's not necessarily a bad thing).  Wireframes are valuable if you need to get input from other people and can't just make a website that looks like whatever you want. 

- Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?

	Playing with the color schemes and looking at the final product. 

- Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

	All the positioning. </br> <img src="http://i1.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/006/199/x-all-the-y.png" />
