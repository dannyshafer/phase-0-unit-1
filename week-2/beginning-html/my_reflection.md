## 4. Beginning HTML Reflection

<<<<<<< HEAD
#### I spent 2 hours on this challenge.

- What makes sense to you about HTML? What doesn't?
	
	HTML is pretty straightforward. It makes almost perfect sense to me. It might get confusing when I try to integrate other languages and libraries like javascript and jQuery. 

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

	The good is that you can make all your content appear pretty easily. The bad is that it just looks pretty ok without any external intervention from CSS, js, et al. So there's a proliferation of languages that you have to know to get an aesthetically pleasing website. 

- Did you have any "aha" moments where any concepts solidified? What were they?

	Not so far, but the week is young. ;)

- Did you have any previous experience with HTML/CSS? If so, how much? If not, how hard did you feel it was to learn?

	I've been doing web development for a while and so this has been a good review of the fundamentals and good chance to round out my existing knowledge.

- Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list them.
	
	More for reference than anything else: http://overapi.com/html and http://overapi.com/css/
