## 2. Site Planning Reflection

#### I spent 2 hours on this challenge.

### Site planning

1. What is your site's primary goal or purpose?

	The site's primary goal is to demonstrate what I've learned at DBC, why I'd be a great addition to a software engineering team, and most importantly: that I'm a decent person that other people will enjoy working with. 

2. What kind of content will your site feature?

	There will be the cultural and technical blog posts. I may also merge my existing blog into it at some point. 

3. What is the best way to share that content with users?

	Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn

4. Think about your target audience. What are their interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

	The target audience would be hiring managers and friends who are interested in what I've been doing lately. It'll be nice to be able to refer them to this site. 

5. How do you think most users will find your site?

	At the moment it looks pretty bland and blank. So they'll probably find it boring. Hopefully not for long though. ;)

6. What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

	I think for hiring managers I'd like to see them looking at my portfolio/GitHub account so that they can see what skills I've practiced. For other visitors, friends in particular, there's probably not a lot for them. Reading specificly prompted week-to-week rants about technology and culture are not particularly what my friends would care to spend time on.

### Site map

Your site map:

<!-- Your link to add it inline goes here-->

- What did you learn about design and user experience?
- Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun planning your site and creating a site map? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
- What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
- What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?
- How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge?
- Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
- Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
