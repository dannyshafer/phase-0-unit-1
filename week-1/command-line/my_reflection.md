# 1: Command Line Reflection

Write your reflection on a document or by hand on the following questions. Keep track of your answers because you'll be asked to add them to this document in challenge [7: Tracking Changes](../7-tracking-changes).

1. What is a shell? What is "bash?"
  A shell is the interface that you use to access your computer at the sub-graphical level. In other words, interacting with the computer through text. Bash is shell on steroids, or version 2.0 if you will, which adds a lot of functionality and is much easier to use than the old shell. It'll also let you stop and start commands easily, which is important when you're constantly starting and stopping rails server.

2. What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?
  There's just a lot of commands to memorize. That's not an insurmountable challenge or anything but it's a lot to take in. Applying them has been helpful not just for memorization, but also for understanding how they work together to make your workflow happen.

3. Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?
  Successfully indeed. :D

4. In your opinion, what are the most important arguments to know?
  In my experience, cd is huge, the whole git init - add - commit - push cycle is super crucial. The other ones seem less important just because I've been able to make websites without them. But it's good to have a deeper dive into this for going forward.

5. Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.

-`pwd`: prints the directory you're working in at the time

-`ls`: lists files and is usually passed with a parameter so that you can find particular files

-`grep`: searches within your file for a string that is passed to it at the same time

-`mv`: move file

-`cd`: change directory 

-`../`: used to change directory to a peer directory from where you are at the moment because the .. takes you back to the folder above and then whatever comes after the slash is the next folder down

-`touch`: changes the timestamp associated with the last time that you accessed the file

-`mkdir`: makes a directory

-`echo`: repeats back a string that you pass

-`less`: shows the contents of a file and can be passed with options to customize output like -M to read

-`rmdir`: remove directory

-`cat`: it allows you to concatenate multiple files

-`rm`: remove file

-`help`: hooks you up with an explanation overview of how various commands work

-`exit`: closes shell
