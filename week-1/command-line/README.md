## Summary
Programmers do not always have pretty ways to interface or test their code. Most spend a good deal of time in their command line - "a tool where you can use text commands to perform specific tasks." When you use the command line, you don't slow yourself down opening a finder and double-clicking on folders. Instead, you get to navigate around your computer, open, create, delete, move, files, etc. all using commands. It's quick, efficient, and easy once you get the hang of it.

Knowing how to use your command line will be vital to your success as a programmer-- and it's the first place to start getting acclimated to this new way of using your computer.

Unfortunately (or fortunately), the command line is very simple. There are specific commands that will do certain things, so it's easy to learn how to do a lot via the command prompt which should save you some time using your mouse. That said, it's not incredibly fun since using it well requires rote memorization and constant practice.

**Please note: this course suggests a lot of work: making flashcards etc. While you may choose to do that, you might also just prefer to make a cheat sheet for yourself and go through the tutorial in a couple of hours.**

## Releases

## Release 0: Read
Read *Learning the Bash Shell* [Chapter 1](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/learning-the-bash/0596009658/ch01.html). Most of the book should be available online through this link. If you have trouble accessing it, please create a trial account to read the two chapters required for this challenge. 

As a warning, this reading is dense so don't expect yourself to understand every little bit of it. It's about getting some context on the shell in advance of using it. Take what you can from it. We are looking to create a more beginner-friendly resource, but haven't had the time yet. 

## Release 1: Crash Course
Now go through the [Command Line Crash Course](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/) to get some practice using the command line.

## Release 2: Read
Read *Learning the Bash Shell* [Chapter 3](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/learning-the-bash/0596009658/ch03.html). In this chapter, you should start understanding your environment. Knowing a bit about this will be valuable prior to setting up your computer in the next challenge. This is similarly dense, so try to get what you can out of it. 

## Release 3: Reflect
Reflecting is essential for solidifying your learning. If you aren't much of a writer, but are more of a talker, you can create video reflections. You'll need to include a link to your reflection video when you get your own copy of the curriculum. Because you don't have that yet, you'll need to keep track of your answers to the questions in the [reflection file](my_reflection.md) on your computer or in your notes. Be sure to write them down! You'll be expected to add them to the reflection file associated with this challenge later once you learn to push changes to GitHub. Limit your reflection time to about 10-15 minutes.
