# 2: Intermediate Command Line Exploration

Answer the following prompts to reflect on your learning. Keep track of your answers because you'll be asked to add them to this document in challenge [7: Tracking Changes](../7-tracking-changes).

1. Summarize the reasons you would use command line tools.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Command line tools are important to use because of the amount of directories that you'll need to be moving to and from. Within the directories you'll be running rails servers, making other directories, and searching for other files, besides sending work to Git and GitHub. These are all things that can be done independently of the terminal, but it makes things a lot easier. 

2. Explain how `pushd` and `popd` work.

The pushd command works like cd but makes a record of each directory that you use.  Then, if you later want to revisit the trail of directories, you can use popd and it will take you back sequentially.

3. What do `less` and `more` do?

<<<<<<< HEAD
Less and more help you navigate all the ins and outs of very large files. Without using one of these comomands, there will be a huge cascade of text when opening large files. But if you use less or more, the text will come up in page format that can be navigated through easily.

4. How should you find files that contain certain text?

<<<<<<< HEAD
You would do this with the grep followed by the "string to be searched for" in quotes and suffixed with the name of the file to be queried.

5. How can you find files that have a certain name?

<<<<<<< HEAD
To do that, you'd use "find . -name and filename.type"


6. Briefly describe the computer environment and how it works.

The computer environment is a series of tubes. Just kidding! :D The computer environment is actually a series of nested and branched environments that inherit processes and behaviors to and from each other in a hierarchy.
