## 2. GitHub Introduction Reflection

### From GitHub Introduction Challenge

- Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience.

	Imagine you're writing a document with three friends. You write some of it and then send it to the second person. He writes his piece and e-mails it to the third person. While she's making her contribution, you realize that you need to make a change. The problem is, you have to ask for her copy and then e-mail your friends afterwards. Git is a way of managing a lot of peoples' changes at the same time and bringing them all together during development and when it's done. GitHub is a centralized repository that allows you to do git, but rather than being on a single computer or a single network, it is location-agnostic because you can use it on any computer with an internet connection.

- Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.

	Version control is the process of recording the state of files at a given time. By doing this, you are free to make changes along the way and as long as you create these snapshots, you can easily revert to previous file versions. GitHub, as mentioned in the last answer, makes the version control available to any computer with internet access.

- Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?

	Developers use version control to more easily keep track of changes made to their files. This empowers them to be more experimental in coding because they know they can go back if something doesn't work, which it usually doesn't right away. Using version control makes perfect sense.

- What doesn't make sense? What does?

	So far the only thing that continues to throw me for a loop is merging branches with other branches but I'll get it soon. The rest of it makes sense.

### From Fork and Clone challenge

- Create your own step-by-step fork and clone instructions for later use
	1. navigate to the repo you want to fork and click the fork button so you own a copy
	2. find and copy the url for the repo you're trying to clone
	3. open terminal and cd to the directly you want it to live in 
	4. use "git clone url" to begin the download
	5. ball so hard

- What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?

	The first time I set up git and GitHub a few months ago, it took over four hours and it was one of the most frusturating things done this year. But then I learned how it works and now it's no problem. :D

- Did you have any moments where it all clicked? What clicked?

	There wasn't a single moment where it worked, just a lot of baby steps quashing the problems I'd had. At some point, after watching enough tutorials and configuring enough things, there just wasn't anything else that could go wrong and I knew enough to keep the ball rolling. The rest is history.
