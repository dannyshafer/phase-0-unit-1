# U1.W1: Thinking About Time Reflection

* How do you manage your time currently?
<<<<<<< HEAD
  I manage my time pretty well during the day and not as well at night. There's definitely room for improvement in terms of   boxing my time and setting specific goals for a particular time period. 

* Is your current strategy working? If not, why not? 
  My current strategy, which isn't really formalized, just entails working when I can and playing when I can. That's been working so far, but I know for sure that I'm not as productive as I could be.

* What techniques did you look into during this challenge that interested you?
  The Pomodoro Technique is one that I used to do and will definitely pick up again. That 25 minute demarcation is a sweet spot and whoever came up with it is genius. The counter intuitive tips were...just as the name says and very thought provoking. While I didn't quite believe all of them, the second one was worth further contemplation.

* Can/will you employ any of them? If so, how?
  I'll definitely bring the Pomodoro Technique into coding. I've definitely used it in the past to power through way more coding than I do when just going into a time of working without a set plan.
  
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0 time management?
  Besides using Poms, I think there's just a lot to be said for the value of meditation to get you in the zone so you can shed whatever else is going on in your brain prior to beginning a Pom. That'll allow you to make the most of the 25 minutes.
