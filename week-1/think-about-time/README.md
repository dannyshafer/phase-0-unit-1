# U1.W1: Thinking about Time

## Learning Competencies
- Research time management and productivity
- Explain "Time Boxing" and describe how to use it

## Summary
Remote learning is challenging, especially if you prefer to learn with others. In this challenge you will do some research on time management, productivity, and mindfulness so you can design a plan for your learning during Phase 0.

Read/watch a few of the resources below, until you find something that interests you. Once you do, search for more resources on the subject/technique, and browse whatever you find.

Try to push yourself to read outside your comfort zone. Expand your awareness of strategies for time management and productivity. Can you apply any of what you come across to your situation?

## Release 0: Research
Research Time Management, Productivity, and Mindfulness using the following (or other) resources as your starting point. 'Sprawl' by searching for more resources related to the topics below.

Cover as much ground as quickly as you can, getting an idea of the borders around the subject without charting every square inch. You want to understand the scope of this challenge before you dig into a particular sub-set.

It's easy to get carried away with research, so limit yourself to an hour for this challenge.

After you've gotten a glimpse of the lay of the land, go back and spend more time with anything that sounded interesting. You should have a decent idea about what is out there, so now you can explore the areas that really interest you.

## Release 2: Reflect

Reflecting is essential for solidifying your learning. You will be expected to complete a reflection for each challenge in Phase 0. It will help you learn how you learn, give opportunities for sharing resources, and help your instructors gauge your progress. Reflections are for you, but they will also be read by others, so make sure to write for an audience. If you feel more comfortable talking as opposed to writing, you can make video reflections.

**Adding reflections for each challenge is mandatory.**

Reflections should be about a paragraph long, and only take you about ten minutes to write.

Please go to the [reflection associated with this challenge](my_reflection.md) to read the prompts and reflect on your learning. You should write the reflection in a file on your computer or on paper. You will add it to GitHub in a later challenge, so don't lose it.
