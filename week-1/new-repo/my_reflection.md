## 4. Open Source and Repo Setup  Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
<<<<<<< HEAD
 
  To make a repository on GitHub, click the "New Repository" button in the top right corner of the homepage. Then enter a      name and select options pertaining to description, privacy setting, README, etc. Then click the "Create repository" and      it's all set to go on the GitHub side. Now on the computer, navigate in the terminal to the root directory of the project    and do "git init", "git add .", "git commit -m 'helpful message with ASCII cat for readability'", and then "git remote add   origin <url.git>" and finally, "git push -u origin master". This creates a repository and then synchronizes its presence in   the cloud. 

* Describe what open source means
 
  Open source means that the code is open and available to the public for for production and consumption. In other words,      anyone can download it and run the program. At the same time, anyone can contribute and make the software better if they     have an idea. Because of the way git works, a change has to be approved by an admin before becoming part of the master       branch, but anyone can try. 

* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
 
  I feel pretty good about open source software. There are times that it'd be nice if GitHub allowed private repos without a   premium subscription (thus suggesting I wish I could make private websites, etc) but overall, our lives have gotten so much   better as a result of lots of open source software. On net, then, I'd say we're better off. 

* Assess the importance of using licenses

  I haven't found it too necessary personally, but adding one to a repo isn't difficult and it at least ensures that the       author gets attribution for the code that he produced. In the case of non open source code, a license is crucial because     it'll ensure that a content crator can seek legal remedy for infractions on his intellectual property. 
  
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

  Having some experience with GitHub and repos already, this wasn't too much of a challenge. At the same time, it's always     appreciated: the chance to see a full walkthrough of the steps to create a repo.
